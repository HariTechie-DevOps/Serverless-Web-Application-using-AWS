# üöÄ Project Setup & Deployment:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Static Website on S3
- Create an S3 Bucket:
  - Name the bucket (e.g., `my-serverless-webapp`) and enable static website hosting in the bucket properties.
- Upload Website Files:
  - Upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the bucket.
- Configure Bucket Policy: 
  - Update the bucket policy to allow public read access so that CloudFront can retrieve the content.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure CloudFront
- Create a CloudFront Distribution: 
  - Set your S3 bucket as the origin.
  - Configure caching settings as needed.
  - (Optional) Enable HTTPS by associating an SSL/TLS certificate.
  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up AWS Route53
- Register or Use an Existing Domain:
  - In Route53, configure a hosted zone for your domain.
- Create DNS Records:  
  - Set up an A or CNAME record pointing to your CloudFront distribution. This directs your custom domain traffic to your application.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Develop & Deploy AWS Lambda Functions
- Write Your Lambda Code:
  - Create functions (using Node.js, Python, etc.) that implement your backend logic.
- Configure API Gateway (Optional): 
  - If your Lambda functions are to be invoked via REST API calls, set up an API Gateway to route HTTP requests to Lambda.
- Deploy Your Functions:
  - Use the AWS Lambda console, CLI, or CI/CD pipelines to deploy your code.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Amazon DynamoDB
- Create a DynamoDB Table: 
  - Define a table with the required primary key (e.g., `UserID` or `ItemID`).
- Integrate with Lambda: 
  - Modify your Lambda functions to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on DynamoDB.
  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Monitoring
- Test the Website:
  - Access your custom domain to verify that the static content is served via CloudFront.
- Test the API: 
  - Invoke your Lambda functions (directly or through API Gateway) and ensure that they interact with DynamoDB correctly.
- Monitor with CloudWatch: 
  - Use CloudWatch logs to review Lambda function performance and diagnose issues.
